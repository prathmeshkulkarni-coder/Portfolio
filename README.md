# PRK Portfolio

A structured and production-focused backend developer portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

This portfolio highlights real-world backend problem solving, deployment experience, and system architecture decisions — not just UI projects.

---

## 🚀 About

This portfolio represents my backend-focused development approach.

Rather than showcasing multiple small projects, it highlights one production-ready full-stack system (ShopX) and breaks down:

- Production deployment challenges
- Authentication architecture
- Role-based access control
- CORS & cookie handling
- Secure file uploads
- System debugging process

The goal is to demonstrate engineering thinking, not just feature implementation.
